//! ACP-tunnel capability source (Facade mode): serves **client-declared** MCP
//! servers as a **session-aware in-process capability source** of the OAB MCP
//! Facade (`openab_mcp::mcp::sources`), replacing the per-session loopback
//! proxy as the default transport. Identity comes from the broker-minted
//! session token (`OPENAB_SESSION_TOKEN` in the agent's env → `Authorization`
//! header → `SessionCtx`), and calls route into the MCP-over-ACP tunnel the
//! proxy used — `channel_id` semantics unchanged.
//!
//! Root-hosted because it needs both worlds: `openab_mcp`'s source trait and
//! `openab_core`'s tunnel bridge (core and the mcp crate stay independent).
//!
//! **One source, N servers** (ADR §6.2). Facade sources are registered once at
//! construction, so there is no source-per-declared-server; this one fans out
//! internally, routing the `<server>.<tool>` prefix to the right tunnel.
//!
//! **Routing is by what the server published, not by the tool name's shape**
//! (F5). A tool is routed to the server whose discovered `tools/list` contained
//! it — a generic server may publish a bare `build`, or a name whose first
//! segment is not its own, and both stay callable. The declared server `name`
//! (from `{type:"acp", id, name}`; the client mints a fresh `id` per connection
//! while `name` is stable) then resolves to `(channel_id, id)` through the
//! registry's `resolve_by_name`, and the published tool name is forwarded
//! unchanged because the server's own `tools/call` expects it. The `<server>.`
//! prefix is only a pre-discovery fallback for routing.
//!
//! **One catalog builds both the advertised names and the routes** ([`catalog`]).
//! Looking the publisher up per call was not enough once two servers could
//! publish the same name: the catalog advertised both, the second was
//! unreachable (nothing addressed it), and which of the two schemas was shown
//! for the shared name depended on iteration order while the call resolved
//! elsewhere. Every advertised name is now paired with the
//! `(declared_server, published_tool)` that produced it, in one deterministic
//! construction that `tools()` advertises and `call()` routes by — so a name
//! that was advertised is callable, and reaches the server whose schema was
//! shown for it. Collisions are named apart rather than dropped: the keeper of
//! a published name advertises it verbatim and the rest appear as
//! `<declared_server>.<published_tool>`.
//!
//! **Admission is the transport, not an allowlist** (D-29, reversing D-20).
//! There is no operator `[[mcp.acp_servers]]` gate: any server that authenticates
//! to `/acp` and declares itself may publish every tool it lists, because the
//! extension already authenticates to reach the tunnel and a second allowlist
//! duplicated that intent. Discovery is therefore driven by what is *attached*,
//! not by a configured list — `tools()` enumerates `attached_server_names` and
//! resolves each to an id through `resolve_by_name`. Names only, one collapse
//! rule: the enumerating `tunnel.servers(channel_id)` deleted in `74315a60`
//! (which collapsed same-name entries in registry order rather than by
//! generation, resolving to a stale tunnel) is *not* revived — the new
//! enumerator returns names, and the single `resolve_by_name` still does every
//! name → id resolution beside the eviction that makes it unique.
