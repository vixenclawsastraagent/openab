# Contributing to OpenAB

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers what we expect in issues and pull requests.

For the full rationale behind the PR guidelines, see the [PR Contribution Guidelines ADR](/docs/adr/pr-contribution-guidelines.md).

## Issue Guidelines

The fastest way to file an issue is to use the [issue templates](https://github.com/openabdev/openab/issues/new/choose) — they auto-apply the correct labels and pass automated validation.

### Issue Types

| Type | Template | Required Sections |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Bug | [bug.yml](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml) | Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Behavior |
| Feature | [feature.yml](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml) | Description, Use Case |
| Documentation | [documentation.yml](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation.yml) | Description |
| Guidance | [guidance.yml](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/guidance.yml) | Question |
| RFC | [rfc.yml](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc.yml) | Proposal (free-form, no heading validation) |

### Filing Without a Template

If you file an issue via CLI or API (bypassing the template UI), keep these rules in mind:

1. **Title prefix helps auto-detection.** The following prefixes are recognized:
   - `fix(...)` or `bug(...)` → Bug
   - `feat(...)` or `feature(...)` → Feature
   - `docs(...)` or `documentation(...)` → Documentation
   - `RFC:` → RFC

2. **Use the required headings** (as `##` or `###`). Common synonyms are accepted:

   | Required Field | Accepted Synonyms |
   |----------------|-------------------|
   | Description | Problem, Summary, Overview, Background, What happened, Bug description |
   | Steps to Reproduce | Reproduction, How to reproduce, Repro steps, Steps to replicate, Repro |
   | Expected Behavior | Expected result, What should happen, Expected behaviour, Expected outcome |
   | Use Case | Motivation, Why, Rationale, Use cases, Why it matters, Benefits, Proposal |
   | Question | (no synonyms) |

3. **Headings must have content.** An empty heading or `_No response_` does not count.

### Automated Validation

A GitHub Action ([issue-check.yml](/.github/workflows/issue-check.yml)) runs on every issue open, edit, and label event:

- **Missing type label + unrecognizable format** → `incomplete` label is added, a bot comment asks you to wait for a maintainer to apply a type label.
- **Type is known but required sections are missing** → `incomplete` label is added, a bot comment lists exactly what's missing.
- **All required sections present** → `incomplete` label is automatically removed.

To fix an `incomplete` issue, simply edit the issue body to add the missing sections — no need to close and re-open.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Every PR must address the following in its description. The [PR template](/.github/pull_request_template.md) will prompt you for each section.

### Review Contract

Every PR must include the exact `## Review Contract` structure defined in the
[Review Contract policy](/docs/review-contract.md): Goal, Non-goals, Accepted
Residual Risks, Acceptance Criteria, and Follow-ups. Each subsection must
contain meaningful content. For small changes, `None` or `Not applicable` must
include a brief reason.

The author proposes the contract, reviewers challenge it during the first full
review, and a maintainer/owner freezes it. The author cannot unilaterally accept
correctness, security, operational, or data-loss risks. After the freeze,
review is incremental: unresolved findings, new changes, regressions, and the
frozen Acceptance Criteria. Broader hardening is a non-blocking Follow-up
unless it passes the policy's Late Blocker Gate.

The default stopping sequence is full review and freeze, fix verification, then
a final regression check. Contract revisions and additional rounds require an
explicit maintainer/owner decision. The `Review Contract` workflow validates
structure only; maintainers remain responsible for semantic approval. A
maintainer may document an exceptional case and apply the
`review-contract-exempt` label.

### 0. Discord Discussion URL

All PRs **must** include a Discord Discussion URL in the PR body (e.g. `https://discord.com/channels/...`). Discussing your idea in Discord before opening a PR helps align on direction and avoids wasted effort. PRs without a Discord Discussion URL will be **automatically closed in 24 hours**.

### 1. What problem does this solve?

Describe the pain point or requirement in plain language. Link the related issue.

### 2. At a Glance

Provide an ASCII diagram showing the high-level flow or where your change fits in the system. For docs-only or trivial changes, write "N/A".

### 3. Prior Art & Industry Research

**Required for architectural, runtime, agent, scheduling, delivery, or persistence changes.** For docs-only, chore, CI, release, or trivial bug fixes, write "Not applicable" with a brief reason.

When prior art research is required, investigate at minimum:

- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** — the largest open-source AI agent gateway
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** — Nous Research's self-hosted agent with multi-platform messaging

Include links to relevant source code, documentation, or discussions. If neither project addresses the problem, state that explicitly with evidence.

### 4. Proposed Solution

Describe your technical approach, architecture decisions, and key implementation details.

### 5. Why This Approach

Explain why you chose this approach over the alternatives found in your research. Be explicit about:

- Tradeoffs you accepted
- Known limitations
- How this could evolve in the future

### 6. Alternatives Considered

List approaches you evaluated but did not choose, and explain why they were rejected.

### 7. Validation

Pick the checks relevant to your PR type:

- **Rust changes:** `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`
- **Helm chart changes:** `helm lint`, `helm template`
- **CI/workflow changes:** workflow syntax validation, dry-run where possible
- **Docs-only changes:** links are valid, renders correctly in GitHub preview

Describe any manual testing performed and add unit tests for new functionality.

## Why We Require Prior Art Research

OpenAB is a young project. We want every design decision to be informed by what's already working in production elsewhere. This:

- Prevents reinventing the wheel
- Surfaces better patterns we might not have considered
- Documents the design space for future contributors
- Makes reviews faster — reviewers don't have to do the research themselves

## Development Setup

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo check
```

## Development Tips

### Agent subprocess environment

OAB spawns agent adapters (agy-acp, codex-acp, etc.) as child processes with a **minimal environment** — only env vars explicitly listed in `[agent].env` config are passed. No `.profile`, `.bashrc`, or login shell is sourced.

If your agent adapter spawns further subprocesses (e.g. `agy`, `codex`), those tools may depend on PATH entries set up by shell init files (fnm, nvm, cargo, etc.). **Do not rely on login shells (`bash -lc`)** — shell metacharacters in user prompts will break argument passing.

Instead, augment PATH directly in your adapter code:

```rust
fn augmented_path() -> String {
    let home = std::env::var("HOME").unwrap_or_else(|_| "/home/agent".to_string());
    let base = std::env::var("PATH").unwrap_or_else(|_| "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin".to_string());
    format!("{home}/bin:{home}/.local/bin:{home}/.local/share/fnm/aliases/default/bin:{base}")
}

// Then when spawning:
Command::new("/usr/local/bin/agy")
    .args(&args)
    .env("PATH", augmented_path())
    .spawn();
```

### E2E testing PRs

Use the PR Preview Build workflow for fast iteration. For the complete
workflow, safety requirements, acceptance criteria, evidence template, and
cleanup steps, see [Canary Testing Pull Requests](/docs/canary-tests.md).

```bash
# 1. Push code to PR branch
# 2. A maintainer builds the image from the upstream workflow on main.
#    The workflow resolves and checks out the PR head automatically.
gh workflow run pr-preview.yml --repo openabdev/openab \
  --ref main -f pr_number=<N> -f variant=<antigravity|codex|claude|default>

# 3. Wait for build
gh run view <run_id> --repo openabdev/openab --json conclusion -q .conclusion

# 4. Deploy and test (depends on your environment)
#    - Kubernetes: kubectl rollout restart deployment/<name>
#    - ECS Fargate (OAB fleet): [ecsctl](https://github.com/oablab/ecsctl) restart <bot> --wait
#    - Local: docker run with the PR image tag
```

**Never run two instances with the same bot token** — both receive messages and send duplicate/conflicting responses.

## Code Style

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR

## Platform Schema

When modifying a platform adapter (`crates/openab-gateway/src/adapters/*.rs`), check whether the change affects the platform's documented capabilities or feature status. If it does, update the corresponding `docs/platforms/schema/<platform>.toml`.

If you notice a platform's official API has changed (a new webhook event type, a deprecated field, etc.) or spot a platform-specific quirk while working on something else, update the corresponding `docs/platforms/schema/<platform>.toml` (`[capability.*]` or `[[quirks]]`) in the same PR. Schema files have no dedicated owner — do not wait for one to notice.

See [`docs/platforms/README.md`](docs/platforms/README.md) for:
- The three-schema structure (capability, feature-support, quirks)
- How to add a new feature to the closed set
- How to add a new platform
- Architecture: TOML (machine facts) vs `docs/<platform>.md` (human setup guide)

CI runs conformance tests on schema changes — missing features, invalid enums, or broken code-ref `source` fields will fail the build.

## PR Lifecycle

Every PR follows a label-driven lifecycle that keeps the review loop moving.

### Label Transitions

| Current State | Trigger | Action |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| `pending-contributor` | No author activity for 2 days | Add `closing-soon` |
| `closing-soon` | No author activity for 3 more days | Auto-close PR |
| `pending-contributor` | Author adds a comment | Remove `pending-contributor`, add `pending-maintainer` |
| `closing-soon` | Author adds a comment | Remove `closing-soon` and `pending-contributor`, add `pending-maintainer` |

### Key Rules

- **`pending-contributor`** — the ball is on the contributor; maintainers are waiting for updates.
- **`closing-soon`** — warning that the PR will be auto-closed if no response within 3 days. For PRs missing a Discord Discussion URL, auto-close happens in 24 hours.
- **Author comment always resets** — any comment by the PR author removes `pending-contributor` and `closing-soon`, flipping the PR back to `pending-maintainer`.
- **Re-check may re-apply `closing-soon`** — after the flip, automated checks still run. If blockers remain (e.g., missing Discord URL, CI failure, `needs-rebase`), `closing-soon` will be re-applied immediately, keeping the ball on the contributor.
- **Immediate `closing-soon`** — in some cases (e.g., missing Discord Discussion URL), `closing-soon` is applied immediately without waiting for the stale period. Auto-close follows in 24 hours.

### Maintainer Take-Over of Fork PRs

PRs from personal forks cannot always be finished on the contributor's branch:
maintainer bots authenticate with GitHub App installation tokens, which GitHub
does not allow to push to fork branches (the "Allow edits by maintainers"
mechanism only applies to user credentials). Rather than blocking a good
contribution on back-and-forth for small fixes, a maintainer may **take over**
the PR:

1. **Agree on direction first.** Take-over happens after a maintainer review,
   when the approach is accepted and only nits or mechanical fixes remain —
   or when the contributor is unresponsive and the change is worth landing.
2. **Preserve attribution.** Cherry-pick the contributor's commits onto a new
   branch in this repository so the original commit author is preserved. If
   commits must be rewritten or squashed, add a
   `Co-authored-by: username <username@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer
   (GitHub requires the `Name <email>` form; the noreply address avoids
   exposing a real email).
3. **Credit in the PR description.** The replacement PR must mention the
   original contributor with `@username` and link the original PR
   (e.g. "Supersedes #123, carrying forward @contributor's work").
4. **Finish the nits and merge.** The maintainer applies the remaining review
   feedback on the new branch and merges once checks pass.
5. **Close the original PR** with a comment linking the replacement, thanking
   the contributor, and noting their authorship is preserved.

Example: #1443 took over #1440.

Contributors who prefer to finish the work themselves can say so on the PR —
take-over is a convenience to get accepted work merged, not a way to bypass
the contributor.
