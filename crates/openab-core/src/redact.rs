//! Rendering session-bearing identifiers in logs without handing out the session.
//!
//! An ACP session is addressed two ways and both carry the same uuid: the session id is
//! `sess_<uuid>` and the channel id is `acp_<uuid>`. Either one is enough to resume — `sess_` is
//! taken directly by resume, and `acp_` differs from it only by prefix — so both are credentials,
//! and a redaction that covers one of them covers nothing.
//!
//! Ids also travel embedded: a pool key is `<platform>:<channel_id>`, so scanning for a field
//! named `channel` misses it entirely. Redaction here matches on the VALUE's shape, which is why
//! it can be applied to a composite without the caller taking it apart.
//!
//! Applying this to a non-ACP identifier is a no-op, deliberately. A Discord or Slack channel id
//! is public and operators grep for it, and because the function leaves it untouched, a caller
//! that cannot tell whether a given id will ever be ACP does not have to find out — applying it
//! is free and removes the question. That is cheaper than an investigation and safer than a guess.

/// Hash any `acp_`/`sess_` prefixed segment of `s`, leaving everything else exactly as it was.
///
/// Segments are split on `:` so a `<platform>:<channel_id>` pool key redacts its id half and keeps
/// the platform readable.
///
/// The same uuid tags identically whichever prefix carried it, so one session reads as one tag
/// across every log line that mentions it — that correlation is the only reason to keep an
/// identifier in a log at all.
